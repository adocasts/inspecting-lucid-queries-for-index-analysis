In this lesson, we'll learn how we can log all or specific queries within our application to see the actual SQL being executed. We'll then, analyze the SQL and learn how to create indexes via migrations

ðŸŽ¯ We'll learn how to:

- Log the SQL being executed via Lucid queries
- Use `analyze explain` in PostgreSQL to see the execution plan for the query
- See the impact a proper index can make on large datasets
- Create and drop indexes via Lucid migrations
